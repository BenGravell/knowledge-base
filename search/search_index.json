This paper asks and answers the question: \"can we learn, in real-time, a nonlinear predictive model of another agent's motions?\" The problem is tackled by using a special kind of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), which comes from the Koopman operator theory, to learn a model of the agent motion. The model also produces uncertainty estimates, which is useful for downstream risk-aware planning &amp; control. This paper combines a lot of smaller techniques (Hankel-DMD, Cadzow projection, Singular Value Hard Thresholding (SVHT), etc.) together into a rather intricate bells-and-whistles learner, but that in itself is nice as it provides the reader some clues into those techniques.</p>"},{"location":"papers/2511_00814/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Paper</li> </ul>"},{"location":"papers/2511_00814/#tags","title":"Tags","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Prediction</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Mode Decomposition</p> </li> </ul>"}]}
