summary: >
  Autonomous systems often must predict the motions of nearby agents from partial and noisy data. This paper asks and answers the question: "can we learn, in real-time, a nonlinear predictive model of another agent's motions?" The problem is tackled by using a special kind of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), which comes from the Koopman operator theory, to learn a model of the agent motion. The model also produces uncertainty estimates, which is useful for downstream risk-aware planning & control. This paper combines a lot of smaller techniques (Hankel-DMD, Cadzow projection, Singular Value Hard Thresholding (SVHT), etc.) together into a rather intricate bells-and-whistles learner, but that in itself is nice as it provides the reader some clues into those techniques.
