# Knowledge Base

Welcome to my curated collection of research papers, ideas, and explanations in the fields of **motion planning**, **optimization**, **robotics**, **machine learning**, and more.

It's where I:

- Document and reflect on academic papers.
- Explore foundational and emerging topics.
- Build explainer content for complex concepts.
- Organize my growing personal understanding in a structured, searchable way.

Whether you're here to deepen your understanding, explore specific research areas, or follow my perspective through complex topics, I hope you find the content useful and engaging.
