WebGPT: Browser-assisted Question-answering with Human Feedback

We fine-tune GPT-3 to answer long-form questions using a text-based web-browsing environment, which allows the model to search and navigate the web. By setting up the task so that it can be performed by humans, we are able to train models on the task using imitation learning, and then optimize answer quality with human feedback. To make human evaluation of factual accuracy easier, models must collect references while browsing in support of their answers. We train and evaluate our models on ELI5, a dataset of questions asked by Reddit users. Our best model is obtained by fine-tuning GPT-3 using behavior cloning, and then performing rejection sampling against a reward model trained to predict human preferences. This model's answers are preferred by humans 56% of the time to those of our human demonstrators, and 69% of the time to the highest-voted answer from Reddit.

## Introduction

A rising challenge in NLP is long-form question-answering (LFQA), in which a paragraph-length answer is generated in response to an open-ended question. LFQA systems have the potential to become one of the main ways people learn about the world, but currently lag behind human performance. Existing work tends to focus on two core components of the task, information retrieval and synthesis.

In this work we leverage existing solutions to these components: we outsource document retrieval to the Microsoft Bing Web Search API,^11^1 and utilize unsupervised pre-training to achieve high-quality synthesis by fine-tuning GPT-3. Instead of trying to improve these ingredients, we focus on combining them using more faithful training objectives. Following Stiennon et al., we use human feedback to directly optimize answer quality, allowing us to achieve performance competitive with humans.

We create a text-based web-browsing environment that a fine-tuned language model can interact . This allows us to improve both retrieval and synthesis in an end-to-end fashion using general methods such as imitation learning and reinforcement learning.

We generate answers with references: passages extracted by the model from web pages while browsing. This is crucial for allowing labelers to judge the factual accuracy of answers, without engaging in a difficult and subjective process of independent research.

We evaluate our best model in three different ways. First, we compare our model's answers to answers written by our human demonstrators on a held-out set of questions. Our model's answers are preferred 56% of the time, demonstrating human-level usage of the text-based browser. Second, we compare our model's answers (with references stripped, for fairness) to the highest-voted answer provided by the ELI5 dataset. Our model's answers are preferred 69% of the time. Third, we evaluate our model on TruthfulQA, an adversarial dataset of short-form questions.

In Section 4, we evaluate our best-performing models (for different inference-time compute budgets) on ELI5 and TruthfulQA.
