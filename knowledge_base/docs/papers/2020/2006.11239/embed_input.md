Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models

Topics include Diffusion models, Probabilistic models, Datasets, Generalization.

We present high quality image synthesis results using diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models inspired by considerations from nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Our best results are obtained by training on a weighted variational bound designed according to a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, and our models naturally admit a progressive lossy decompression scheme that can be interpreted as a generalization of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional dataset, we obtain an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. On 256x256 LSUN, we obtain sample quality similar to ProgressiveGAN. Our implementation is available at

## Introduction

Deep generative models of all kinds have recently exhibited high quality samples in a wide variety of data modalities. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), autoregressive models, flows, and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have synthesized striking image and audio samples, and there have been remarkable advances in energy-based modeling and score matching that have produced images comparable to those of GANs.

This paper presents progress in diffusion probabilistic models. A diffusion probabilistic model (which we will call a "diffusion model" for brevity) is a parameterized Markov chain trained using variational inference to produce samples matching the data after finite time. Transitions of this chain are learned to reverse a diffusion process, which is a Markov chain that gradually adds noise to the data in the opposite direction of sampling until signal is destroyed....

Unfortunately, there are numerous well-known malicious uses of generative models. Sample generation techniques can be employed to produce fake images and videos of high profile figures for political purposes. While fake images were manually created long before software tools were available, generative models such as ours make the process easier. Fortunately, CNN-generated images currently have subtle flaws that allow detection, but improvements in generative models may make this more difficult. Generative models also reflect the biases in the datasets on which they are trained....

On the other hand, diffusion models may be useful for data compression, which, as data becomes higher resolution and as global internet traffic increases, might be crucial to ensure accessibility of the internet to wide audiences. Our work might contribute to representation learning on unlabeled raw data for a large range of downstream tasks, from image classification to reinforcement learning, and diffusion models might also become viable for creative uses in art, photography, and music.

Table 1 shows Inception scores, FID scores, and negative log likelihoods (lossless codelengths) on. With our FID score of 3.17, our unconditional model achieves better sample quality than most models in the literature, including class conditional models....
