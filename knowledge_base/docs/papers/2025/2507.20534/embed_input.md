Kimi K2: Open Agentic Intelligence

We introduce Kimi K2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments. Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities. Notably, K2 obtains 66.1 on Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on SWE-Bench Multilingual - surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in non-thinking settings.

## Introduction

The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) is undergoing a profound paradigm shift towards Agentic Intelligence -- the capabilities for models to autonomously perceive, plan, reason, and act within complex and dynamic environments. This transition marks a departure from static imitation learning towards models that actively learn through interactions, acquire new skills beyond their training distribution, and adapt behavior through experiences. It is believed that this approach allows an AI agent to go beyond the limitation of static human-generated data, and acquire superhuman capabilities through its own exploration and exploitation.

Achieving agentic intelligence introduces challenges in both pre-training and post-training. Pre-training must endow models with broad general-purpose priors under constraints of limited high-quality data, elevating token efficiency---learning signal per token---as a critical scaling coefficient. Post-training must transform those priors into actionable behaviors, yet agentic capabilities such as multi-step reasoning, long-term planning, and tool use are rare in natural data and costly to scale.

In this work, we introduce Kimi K2, a 1.04 trillion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLM with 32 billion activated parameters, purposefully designed to address the core challenges and push the boundaries of agentic capability.

We present MuonClip, a novel optimizer that integrates the token-efficient Muon algorithm with a stability-enhancing mechanism called QK-Clip. Using MuonClip, we successfully pre-trained Kimi K2 on 15.5 trillion tokens without a single loss spike.

## Limitations

In our internal tests, we have identified some limitations in current Kimi K2 models. When dealing with hard reasoning tasks or unclear tool definition, the model may generate excessive tokens, sometimes leading to truncated outputs or incomplete tool calls. Additionally, performance may decline on certain tasks if tool use is unnecessarily enabled. When building complete software projects, the success rate of one-shot prompting is not as good as using K2 under an agentic coding framework. We are working to address these issues in future releases and looking forward to more feedbacks.
